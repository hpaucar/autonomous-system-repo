# SORTINGBYREVERSALS

Suppose we are given a cyclic permutation of the numbers 1; : : : ; n, and we wish to sort it into the identity permutation, so that 1 is followed by 2, which is followed by 3, etc., up to n which is followed by 1. The operation we can apply to change the permutation is to take a segment, of arbitrary length, and reverse it. It is always possible to sort the permutation using at most n ? 1 reversals, but what is the smallest number of reversals? Figure 2.3 shows an example of a permutation of size 5 sorted by two reversals.
