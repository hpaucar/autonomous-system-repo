# Problem: LOGISTICS (linehaul problem)

The problem is the single-day linehaul problem ofa consumer goods distributor, who uses
a fleet of trucks to deliver goods requested by a set of customers. The goods are so-called “fast moving consumer goods”—in other words mainly fresh food—and customers are supermarkets and other retailers. Each truck starts from a central depot, visits a sequence of customers, and returns to the depot at the end. Because the distance from the depot to the area where the cus- tomers are is significant, each truck can make only one such tour in a day. Goods are divided into chilled and ambient, and each customer has requested a certain quantity of each type. Chilled goods can only be transported in refrigerated trucks, while ambient-temperature goods can be sent both on trucks with refrigeration and without. Besides being refrigerated or not, the avail- able truck models also have different capacities and per-kilometer driving costs. The objective is to minimise the total cost which is the sum over all trucks of their per-kilometer cost times the distance travelled. On a given day, some trucks may not be used at all. Figure
